### Aim
To develop a game involving two players.
### Description

Our project name is Tic-Tac-Toe game. It is actually a two player game. In this game, there is a board with n x n squares. In our game, it is 3 x 3 squares. 
The game is to play tic tac toe for fun as it is a nice leisurely game.
One player can choose' X 'and the other player can choose 'O'.
The main aim is to create a straight line win . This could be diagonal or vertical or horizontally  straight-line 'X' or 'O'
Both the players will try to compete with each other to make a straight line before the other .
Problem Statement 
The problem is the mode of playing the game. The game can be played only if we have a pen and paper. So instead of that we can access a mobile using the online platform.
The game is user-friendly. So we don't need any paper or pen.  Just a mobile phone and an internet connection for accessing our game.
This is a fun game to play during our free time.  


### Technology used

We have used python language and we have created functions which we will be using Jupyter notebook and it can be used in google colaboratory also .



### Expected Output/Results

It is a game of two people playing 'X' and 'O' online in which one wins either 'X' or 'O' and if no one wins its a tie.
